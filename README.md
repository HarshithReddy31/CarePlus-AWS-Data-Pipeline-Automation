# CarePlus-AWS-Data-Pipeline-Automation
This project demonstrates how I designed and implemented an end-to-end data pipeline for CarePlus to automate data ingestion, transformation, and analytics using AWS services. The goal was to replace manual workflows with an event-driven, scalable, and secure cloud-based solution.
